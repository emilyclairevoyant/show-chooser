This project was inspired by my struggle to choose a show or movie to watch when I'm trying to watch something. I decided to create a program to make the decision for me to help!

In this repository, I included my personal program to assist in creating your own, as well as a blank copy to do so. The empty brackets in the blank copy are there to input your personal streaming services and watch lists.

This was made for fun, not for class. I enjoyed making it and it has been incredibly helpful and has saved me lots of time making the decision for me, so I hope it helps others as well who struggle with deciding what to watch.
